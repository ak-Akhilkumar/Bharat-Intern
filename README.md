Forecasting the sales of a supermarket :
A supermarket has various departments, and it must stock up items that will be in demand in each of these departments. 
However, while stocking up, it must make sure that it doesnot have excessive stock.

This task of forecasting the sales of a supermarket is done by me under the guidance of the Bharat Intern "Data Analytics" Internship program .
